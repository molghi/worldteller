The legendary founder of the Russian governance project, he is credited with founding the Rurikid dynasty that would rule the Kievan Rus for centuries. Hailing from Normandy (modern-day Sweden), Rurik and his kin were invited by warring Slavic tribes to rule over them in the area now known as Russia, establishing a stable rule and setting the foundation for the rise of the Kievan state. His leadership, alongside his kinsmen, Oleg (Helgi) of Novgorod and Igor (Ingvar) of Kiev, laid the groundwork for the formation of the first East Slavic state and its eventual expansion into a powerful medieval empire."

His inability to address the growing unrest led to his abdication during the February Revolution of 1917, and he was executed by Bolshevik Marxist revolutionaries with his entire family in 1918. In the broader historical context, it is very plausable that the Bolshevik seizure of power — which profoundly destabilized Europe — set the stage for the rise of the Nazis. Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, fueled by anti-Bolshevik sentiment and the fear of communism spreading, seized power in Germany, and in this long chain of events, the bloodshed of the 20th century can, in part, be traced back to Nicholas II's failures."
