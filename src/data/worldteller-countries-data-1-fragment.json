His inability to address the growing unrest led to his abdication during the February Revolution of 1917, and he was executed by Bolshevik Marxist revolutionaries with his entire family in 1918. In the broader historical context, it is very plausable that the Bolshevik seizure of power — which profoundly destabilized Europe — set the stage for the rise of the Nazis.
